# programming-practice 
Every time you program you are "practicing programming". This repo is dedicated to my efforts of "deliberate practice" to the art. Here you'll find a collection of interview questions and answers à la manière de leetcode, HackerRank, etc., as well as small generic scripts that have also helped me to improve at my craft. 

My brilliant former piano teacher once said to me _"Don't take notice of the quote 'practice makes perfect', it's incorrect. It should be 'Perfect practices makes perfect'."_. She was trying to impart the power of [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) onto my young mind. I thought it was wonderfully original. It turns out she probably stole that quote from [Vince Lombardi](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/vince_lombardi_138158).

## Notes
I use various notes to help me practice for interviews, since this is when most of my problem solving abilites get used outside of personal projects. I have some interview tips/links to other resources on my [website](http://wwww.elliotalker.com). I also use my [university notes](https://github.com/elliotalker/university-notes) and I try to update them from time to time, even though it's been a few years since I graduated.
