# programming-practice 

A collection of programming practice and interview questions à la manière de leetcode, HackerRank, etc. These ostensibly help improve my problem solving abilities.


## Code 

### project-euler
Solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Written in Java. 

### leet-code
Backup of [leetcode](http://leetcode.com) solutions. Written in Java, Kotlin and Go.

### generic-questions
Answers to generic programming questions I've found on the web. Written in whatever I feel like at the time

## Notes
I use various notes to help me practice for interviews, since this is when most of my problem solving abilites get used outside of personal projects. I have some interview tips/links to other resources on my [website](wwww.elliotalker.com). I also use my [university notes](https://github.com/elliotalker/university-notes) and I try to update them from time to time, even though it's been a few years since I graduated.
